# LEGO-sets
This is an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring the evolution of LEGO sets over the past 50 years ðŸ“Š
## ðŸ§± About My Project
This project is my personal take on the story behind LEGO â€” not just as a toy, but as a cultural phenomenon. I wanted to explore how LEGO sets have changed over the past 50 years: the themes we loved, the complexity we faced, and how prices evolved. My goal was to build something interactive and insightful â€” not just for data nerds, but for collectors, casual fans, and curious minds alike.
#### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
The main goal was to turn a raw dataset into something that tells a story. I wanted to:

â€¢ Visualize how LEGO themes have shifted over time

â€¢ Track changes in set sizes and pricing

â€¢ Explore the relationship between piece count and price

â€¢ Create an intuitive, interactive dashboard that makes data exploration fun and simple

#### ðŸ’¼ Business Needs
LEGO has grown into one of the most iconic toy brands in the world, with a massive catalog of sets spanning decades. By analyzing trends in themes, pricing, and build complexity, we can uncover valuable insights that speak to both nostalgic collectors and modern-day enthusiasts. This project aims to dive into LEGOâ€™s rich history and uncover the key patterns that have shaped its evolution.

The specific goals of this analysis include:

â€¢Identifying trends in set size, complexity, and pricing

â€¢Recognizing which themes and categories gained popularity over time

â€¢Supporting data-driven decisions for inventory, marketing, and collection planning
