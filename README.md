# LEGO-sets
This is an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring the evolution of LEGO sets over the past 50 years 📊

## About My Project
This project is my personal take on the story behind LEGO — not just as a toy, but as a cultural phenomenon. I wanted to explore how LEGO sets have changed over the past 50 years: the themes we loved, the complexity we faced, and how prices evolved. My goal was to build something interactive and insightful — not just for data nerds, but for collectors, casual fans, and curious minds alike.

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Visualize how LEGO themes have shifted over time  
- Track changes in set sizes and pricing  
- Explore the relationship between piece count and price  
- Create an intuitive, interactive dashboard that makes data exploration fun and simple

### 💼 Business Needs
LEGO has grown into one of the most iconic toy brands in the world, with a massive catalog of sets spanning decades. By analyzing trends in themes, pricing, and build complexity, we can uncover valuable insights that speak to both nostalgic collectors and modern-day enthusiasts. This project aims to dive into LEGO’s rich history and uncover the key patterns that have shaped its evolution.

The specific goals of this analysis include:

- Identifying trends in set size, complexity, and pricing
- Recognizing which themes and categories gained popularity over time
- Supporting data-driven decisions for inventory, marketing, and collection planning

### Approach & Insights
#### 🧼 Data Preparation
The dataset — covering over 18,000 LEGO sets from 1970 to 2022 — was cleaned and structured in Power Query. Null values were removed, unnecessary columns were dropped, and types were corrected.

#### 🔎 Exploratory Analysis
Key metrics explored: average piece count, price distribution, theme popularity, and relationships between age recommendation and cost.

#### 📊 Dashboard Design
Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard with:
- Slicers for filtering by age range, theme, and price  
- KPI cards displaying total sets, average price and pieces  
- A detailed table of LEGO sets  
- Custom tooltips showing thumbnails on hover  
- A dedicated product detail section for each selected set

#### 🧠 Key Insights
LEGO sets have become more detailed and expensive. Themes like Star Wars and Technic remain dominant, and price is driven by more than just piece count.

## 📥 Steps to Complete the LEGO Sets Project

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Dataset downloaded from [Maven Analytics]
- Over 18,000 LEGO sets
- Structure reviewed before loading into Power BI

### 2. Importing into Power BI
- Used “Get Data” to load dataset  
- Opened Power Query for cleaning and transformation

### 3. Data Transformation in Power Query
- Removed nulls and empty rows  
- Renamed columns for readability  
- Changed data types for `age` and `price`
- Created a new conditional column called `Age Range`, which grouped sets into age-based categories:

  <details>
  <summary>Age Range</summary>

  - **Over** – for sets recommended for ages 18+  
  - **10 to 17** – for older children and teens  
  - **5 to 9** – for younger builders  
  - **1 to 4** – for toddler-friendly sets

  </details>

  This made it easier to segment the data by age group in slicers and visuals.

- Created another conditional column named `Price Range`, to classify sets by cost using dollar signs:
  
  <details>
  <summary>Price Range</summary>
  
  - **$$$$$** – sets over $500  
  - **$$$$** – $100 to $500  
  - **$$$** – $50 to $100  
  - **$$** – $5 to $50  
  - **$** – under $5
  
  </details>

  This allowed for quick filtering and intuitive comparison of set prices.

## 🧮 DAX Measures & Calculations

All DAX measures were stored in a dedicated `Measure Table` using the "Enter Data" feature.

### Core Measures

<details>
<summary>Total Sets</summary>

```DAX
Total Sets = DISTINCTCOUNT(lego_sets[set_id])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Total Theme Groups</summary>

```DAX
Total Groups = DISTINCTCOUNT(lego_sets[themeGroup])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Average Age</summary>

```DAX
Avg. Age = AVERAGE(lego_sets[age])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Average Pieces</summary>

```DAX
Avg. Pieces = AVERAGE(lego_sets[pieces])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Average Price</summary>

```DAX
Avg. Price = AVERAGE(lego_sets[price])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Max Price Filter</summary>

```DAX
Max Price Filter = IF([Avg. Price] <= 'Max Price'[Max Price Value], 1, 0)
```
</details>

### 🧠 Dynamic Selection Measures

<details>
<summary>Selected Set</summary>

```DAX
Selected Set = IF(HASONEVALUE(lego_sets[name]), MAX(lego_sets[name]), "Select a Set")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Selected Price</summary>

```DAX
Selected Price = IF(HASONEVALUE(lego_sets[price]), MAX(lego_sets[price]), "-")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Selected Pieces</summary>

```DAX
Selected Pieces = IF(HASONEVALUE(lego_sets[pieces]), MAX(lego_sets[pieces]), "-")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Selected Year</summary>

```DAX
Selected Year = IF(HASONEVALUE(lego_sets[year]), MAX(lego_sets[year]), "-")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Selected Age</summary>

```DAX
Selected Age = IF(HASONEVALUE(lego_sets[age]), MAX(lego_sets[age]), "-")
```
</details>

## 🧮 Parameter Controls

<details>
<summary>Max Price Parameter</summary>

- **Type:** Numeric Range  
- **Min:** 0  
- **Max:** 850  
- **Step:** 5  
- **Default:** 850  

Used to dynamically filter the table by max retail price.

## ✨ Visual Enhancements

### Custom Image Tooltips

When hovering over a table row, users see a preview of the LEGO set.

- Implemented with a separate report page (`Thumbnail`)  
- Tooltip type set to report page  
- Displays image from URL

### Product Detail View

- A dynamic card updates when a set is selected  
- Shows: image, name, price, year, pieces, age  
- Uses `HASONEVALUE()` DAX logic to avoid incorrect aggregation when multiple sets are selected

---

## 📈 Set Explorer (Decomposition Tree)

To provide deeper insights into set distributions, I added a `Set Explorer` page.

- Uses the **Decomposition Tree** visual  
- Explains `Total Sets` by:
  - Category → Theme Group → Theme → Name
- Allows drill-down exploration to find patterns and theme popularity

This page adds a powerful and intuitive breakdown tool for interactive storytelling.

---

## 🔁 Navigation Features

- Buttons allow seamless navigation between pages (`Main`, `Set Explorer`)  
- “Reset Filters” uses bookmarks to clear slicers and reset parameters  
- Interactive cards and slicers give full control over analysis
